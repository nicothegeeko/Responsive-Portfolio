            <p> Nico works full time as a Digital Marketing Manager at Envoy Media Group. She also is an aspiring web developer, who is studying coding in order to advance her marketing skills and expertise. </p>
            <p>
                Nico graduated from the University of Southern California in 2015 with a B.A. in History. Although, Nico may love history, she is also pasionate about video games and technology. Nico has increasingly become more and more involved in the tech/ video game community and hopes that her coding will help her achieve both personal and professional goals.
            </p>
            <p> When Nico isn't working she is often writing about eSports on her personal blog nicothegeeko.com or competing. Nico loves the classic Nintendo game, Super Smash Bros. Melee. She hopes to someday branch her love for video games and marketing by working for Indie Game developers and eSports teams.
